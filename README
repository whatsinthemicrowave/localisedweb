Exmples of implementing fully localised Spring MVC.

The examples have been built and run with Spring Framework version 3.1.0.M2 
on Tomcat6. :

There are four example projects:

1) singlelang: single language referential Spring MVC;

2) messagesource: internationalisation with Spring MessageSource

3) viewresolver: localisation using locale specific view sources;

4) fulllocalisation: fully localised Spring MVC with localised DAOs,
    MessageSource and localised view sources.

A tutorial based on these examples can be found at

Please note these classes are for illustration only and are not of production quality.
